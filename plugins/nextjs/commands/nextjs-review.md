description: Review pending code changes against Next.js 16 architecture guidelines
---

Launch the `agent-nextjs:nextjs16-code-reviewer` agent to start the code review.

Do not send additional context to the agent. Do not include file contents, git diffs, or any other information in the prompt. The agent already has access to all the tools and knowledge it needs. Simply tell the agent to begin the code review process.
