# Voice Prompt Translator

You are receiving raw Spanish speech-to-text input that needs to be translated to English and organized for clarity.

## Input
$ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Translate the above Spanish text to English and organize it for readability. Follow these rules strictly:

### What you MUST do:
1. Translate from Spanish to English accurately
2. Remove filler words and verbal hesitations (um, uh, like, you know, etc.)
3. Organize the content logically with clear paragraph breaks
4. Use bullet points ONLY when listing multiple distinct items or requirements
5. Keep the natural, conversational tone — this should sound like the person speaking, just cleaner

### What you MUST NOT do:
- Do NOT change the intention or meaning in any way
- Do NOT add information that wasn't in the original
- Do NOT remove any details or requirements mentioned
- Do NOT make it sound robotic or overly formal
- Do NOT add explanations, summaries, or meta-commentary
- Do NOT use headers, titles, or excessive formatting

## Output Format

Output ONLY the translated and organized English text. Nothing else — no preamble, no "Here's the translation:", no explanations. Just the clean prompt ready to be used.
