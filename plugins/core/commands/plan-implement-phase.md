# Implement Phase

Implement **Phase $ARGUMENTS** from `plan.md`.

## Before Starting

1. Read the entire plan file to understand the full context
2. Pay special attention to:
   - The "Decisions Made" section — follow these exactly
   - The "Technical Context" section — use the agreed patterns
   - Any research or code snippets included in this phase

## Implementation Rules

1. **Follow the plan precisely** — The plan contains decisions and context from a previous session. Do not deviate unless there's a blocking issue.

2. **Use provided code snippets** — If the phase includes research, documentation links, or code examples, use them as the implementation reference.

3. **Stay within scope** — Only implement what's listed in this phase's tasks. Do not work on other phases.

4. **Check off tasks** — As you complete each task, check it off in the plan file:
   - `- [ ] Task` → `- [x] Task`

5. **Stop when done** — After completing all tasks and deliverables for this phase, stop and report what was done. Do not continue to the next phase.

## When You Encounter Issues

If something in the plan doesn't work or needs adjustment:
1. Explain what the issue is
2. Propose a solution
3. Wait for my approval before deviating from the plan

## Output

After completing the phase:
1. Summarize what was implemented
2. Confirm all deliverables are in place
3. Note any issues or deviations from the plan
4. Remind me to review and commit before moving to the next phase
